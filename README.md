# Disable GoGuardian

### Essentially, this bypass makes GoGuardian seem like an untrusted/dangerous extension, so Google will automatically block the extension from working.

1) Go to chrome://settings/certificates

2) Click on the "Authoritites" tab.

3) Scroll down to `org-amazon`

4) Once you click on `org-amazon`, a drop-down list will appear with things like: `Amazon Root CA 1` and `Amazon Root CA 2 `.
